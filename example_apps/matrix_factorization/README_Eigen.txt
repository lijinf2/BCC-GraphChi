The matrix factorization example apps require Eigen linear algebra
library. It is free software, and available from:

	 http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

To simplify license issues, we do not distribute Eigen directly with our
code.

Simply install the Eigen -directory in this directory or under /usr/local/include.
