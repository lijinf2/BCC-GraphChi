\subsection{Detailed Description}
Unlike in connected components, we need to ensure that neighbors do not overwrite each others values. This is achieved by keeping two values in an edge. In this struct, smaller\-\_\-one is the id of the vertex that has smaller id, and larger\-\_\-one the others. This complexity is due to us ignoring the direction of an edge. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
